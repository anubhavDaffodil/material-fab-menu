# material-fabmenu
This is a FAB menu component to be used with Call-Em-All's excellent React [material-ui library](http://www.material-ui.com/#/)

`npm install material-fabmenu`

Demo and usage snippets can be found [here] (https://theosherry.github.io/projects/fab-menu).

I'll update this with the API in a few days.
